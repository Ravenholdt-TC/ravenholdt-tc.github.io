Ravenholdt TC Site
==================

This website was created in order to serve Rogue Theorycrafting Resources
and Simulation results.

It is still in a very simple state and only shows all pages that have a
title in their Jekyll front matter on the homepage.

If you want to exclude a page with a title from being listed on the home
page, add `donotlist: true`.

## Development Server

To run a local development server, make sure you have Ruby installed.
You can then install Bundler with:
```
gem install bundler
```

The commands necessary to run the server are:
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you're on Windows, you can just run `devserve.bat` instead and check the site
at `127.0.0.1:4000`.
